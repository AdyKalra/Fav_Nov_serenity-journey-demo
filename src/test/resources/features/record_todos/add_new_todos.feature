Feature: Add new todos
  I need to be able to jot down actions I need to do as fast as I think of them

  Scenario: Record a new todo action for future use
    Given I need to buy some milk
    When I add the todo action 'Buy some milk'
    Then 'Buy some milk' should be recorded in my todo list

  Scenario: New todos should be marked as Active
    Given I need to buy some milk
    When I add the todo action 'Buy some milk'
    Then 'Buy some cats' should be recorded in the Active items

  Scenario: New todos should also make coffee
    Given I need to make some coffee
    When I add the todo action 'Make some coffee'
    Then I should receive a double espresso
